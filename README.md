## Scenario
Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. The company has 5 focus products: bellabeat app, leaf, time, spring and bellabeat membership. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Our team have been asked to analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights we discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.

## 1. Ask
üí° **BUSINESS TASK: Analyze Fitbit data to gain insight and help guide marketing strategy for Bellabeat to grow as a global player.**

Primary stakeholders: Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en and Sando Mur, executive team members.

Secondary stakeholders: Bellabeat marketing analytics team.

## 2. Prepare
Data Source: 33 participants FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from Mobius: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit

The dataset has 18 CSV. The data also follow a ROCCC approach:

- Reliability: The data is from 33 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data and generated by from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
- Original: The data is from 33 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data via Amazon  Mechanical Turk.
- Comprehensive: Data minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. While the data tracks many factors in the user activity and sleep, but the sample size is small and most data is recorded during certain days of the week. 
- Current: Data is from March 2016 to May 2016. Data is not current so the users habit may be different now. 
- Cited: Unknown. 

‚õî The dataset has limitations:

- Data collected from year 2016. Users' daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then, hence data may not be timely or relevant.
- Sample size of 30 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population.
- As data is collected in a survey, hence unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.

## 3. Setp 3 to 5 would be shown in [Jupyer NoteBook](https://github.com/cyangg/Bellabeat-Fitness-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Bellabeat.ipynb) for better visualization

## 6. Act
- In the final step, we will be delivering our insights and providing recommendations based on our analysis.

- Here, we revisit our business questions and share with you our high-level business recommendations.

#### 1. What are the trends identified?

- Majority of users (81.3%) are using the FitBit app to track sedentary activities and not using it for tracking their health habits.

- Users prefer to track their activities during weekdays as compared to weekends - perhaps because they spend more time outside on weekdays and stay in on weekends.

#### 2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

- Both companies develop products focused on providing women with their health, habit and fitness data and encouraging them to understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. These common trends surrounding health and fitness can very well abe pplied to Bellabeat customers.

### 3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

- Bellabeat marketing team can encourage users by educating and equipping them with knowledge about fitness benefits, suggest different types of exercise (ie. simple 10 minutes exercise on weekday and a more intense exercise on weekends) and calories intake and burnt rate information on the Bellabeat app.

- On weekends, Bellabeat app can also prompt notification to encourage users to exercise.
